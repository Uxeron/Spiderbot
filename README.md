# Spiderbot
Software for my custom hexapod robot

Note: I managed to construct it fully, but the servos proved to be too weak, so while it could move it's legs, 
it couldn't actually stand up. That's why I created the second version, having learnt a lot while making the first one.
The second version's model is done, and I am currently printing and building it. The code won't be updated until I'll
have the physical model done.

Requires the Adafruit PCA9685 library, available here:
